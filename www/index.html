<h1>Bayesian Classifiers for Java</h1>
<p>This project contains two bayesian classifiers for Java: a Naive
implementation and a Fishers implementation. It's merely a port from Toby
Segaran's python code from his book "Programming Collective Intelligence,"
which is included in the /lib directory.

<p>The only requirement for this library is <a
