<h1>Bayesian Classifiers for Java</h1>  
<p>This project contains two bayesian classifiers for Java: a Naive
implementation and a Fishers implementation. It's merely a port from Toby
Segaran's python code from his book &quot;Programming Collective
Intelligence,&quot; which is included in the /lib directory.  </p>
 
 <p>The only requirement for this library is <a
href="http://javolution.org">javolution</a>.   </p>
 
 <p>It's licensed under the Artistic License.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2> Basically, using ci-bayes is a matter of defining a way to
extract elements from a body of text (an implementation of the WordLister
interface), and then constructing a Classifier.   
<p>A default naive WordListerImpl is supplied with the library.  </p>
<p>A simple example of the NaiveClassifier in use might look like this:</p>
<pre>FisherClassifier fc=new FisherClassifierImpl(); <br />
fc.train(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's tail&quot;,
&quot;good&quot;); <br />
fc.train(&quot;Make money fast!&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;); <br />
String classification=fc.getClassification(&quot;money&quot;); // should be &quot;bad&quot;</pre>There's also a Serializer class provided, which shows
how a given Classifier can be persisted (through Java Serialization, even.)
The class shows how any given classifier can be persisted.  
<p>Other storage mechanisms - like JDBC, JPA, XML, etc. - can be built as
well.</p>
